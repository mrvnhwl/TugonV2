# Feature: Gray Color for Exceeded Length

## Feature Overview

Added **gray color** to indicate when users type more characters/tokens than the expected answer length. This provides visual feedback that they've exceeded the required input.

## Color Scheme

### Before

- 🟢 **Green**: Correct character/token
- 🔴 **Red**: Incorrect character/token
- 🟠 **Orange**: Extra tokens (term mode only)

### After

- 🟢 **Green**: Correct character/token at correct position
- 🔴 **Red**: Incorrect character/token
- ⚪ **Gray**: Extra characters/tokens beyond expected length (typed too much)

## Implementation

### Character-Level Comparison

```typescript
export function compareByCharacter(
  expected: string,
  userInput: string
): string {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxLength; i++) {
    const char = userInput[i] || "";
    const expectedChar = expected[i] || "";

    let color = "red";
    if (char === expectedChar && char !== "") {
      color = "green"; // Correct
    } else if (i >= expected.length && char) {
      color = "gray"; // Beyond expected length
    }
    // else: red (incorrect)

    result += `\\textcolor{${color}}{${escapedChar}}`;
  }
}
```

### Term-Level Comparison

```typescript
export function compareByTerm(expected: string, userInput: string): string {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxLen; i++) {
    const token = userTokens[i] || "";
    const expectedToken = expectedTokens[i] || "";

    let color = "red";
    if (token === expectedToken && token !== "") {
      color = "green"; // Correct
    } else if (!expectedToken && token) {
      color = "gray"; // Extra token beyond expected
    }
    // else: red (incorrect)

    result += `\\textcolor{${color}}{${escapedToken}}`;
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Character Mode - Exact Match

```
Expected: f(x)
User types: f(x)
Result: \textcolor{green}{f}\textcolor{green}{(}\textcolor{green}{x}\textcolor{green}{)}
Display: f(x) [all green] ✅
```

### Example 2: Character Mode - Exceeded Length

```
Expected: f(x)
User types: f(x)=2x-7
Result:
  \textcolor{green}{f}\textcolor{green}{(}\textcolor{green}{x}\textcolor{green}{)}
  \textcolor{gray}{=}\textcolor{gray}{2}\textcolor{gray}{x}\textcolor{gray}{-}\textcolor{gray}{7}
Display: f(x)=2x-7 [f(x) green, =2x-7 gray] ⚪
```

### Example 3: Character Mode - Wrong Then Exceeded

```
Expected: f(x)
User types: f(a)hello
Result:
  \textcolor{green}{f}\textcolor{green}{(}\textcolor{red}{a}\textcolor{red}{)}
  \textcolor{gray}{h}\textcolor{gray}{e}\textcolor{gray}{l}\textcolor{gray}{l}\textcolor{gray}{o}
Display: f(a)hello [f( green, a) red, hello gray] 🔴⚪
```

### Example 4: Term Mode - Exact Match

```
Expected: 2x+3
Tokens: ["2", "x", "+", "3"]
User types: 2x+3
Tokens: ["2", "x", "+", "3"]
Result: All tokens green ✅
```

### Example 5: Term Mode - Extra Tokens

```
Expected: 2x+3
Tokens: ["2", "x", "+", "3"]
User types: 2x+3+5
Tokens: ["2", "x", "+", "3", "+", "5"]
Result:
  \textcolor{green}{2}\textcolor{green}{x}\textcolor{green}{+}\textcolor{green}{3}
  \textcolor{gray}{+}\textcolor{gray}{5}
Display: 2x+3+5 [2x+3 green, +5 gray] ⚪
```

### Example 6: Term Mode - Wrong Token Then Extra

```
Expected: 2x+3
Tokens: ["2", "x", "+", "3"]
User types: 2y+3+5
Tokens: ["2", "y", "+", "3", "+", "5"]
Result:
  \textcolor{green}{2}\textcolor{red}{y}\textcolor{green}{+}\textcolor{green}{3}
  \textcolor{gray}{+}\textcolor{gray}{5}
Display: 2y+3+5 [2 green, y red, +3 green, +5 gray] 🟢🔴🟢⚪
```

## User Benefits

### Visual Feedback

- **Immediate indication** when answer is too long
- **Clear distinction** between wrong (red) and extra (gray)
- **Helps users** understand they need to remove excess characters

### Learning Aid

- Shows exactly where expected answer ends
- Helps students understand answer format requirements
- Reduces confusion about answer length

### Problem Prevention

- Prevents submitting answers that are too long
- Encourages concise, correct answers
- Helps identify when students are adding unnecessary information

## Use Cases

### 1. Simple Function Evaluation

```
Question: "Evaluate using f(8)"
Expected: "f(8)"
Student types: "f(8)=9"
Feedback: f(8) [green] =9 [gray]
Message: "You only need to write f(8), not the full evaluation"
```

### 2. Expression Simplification

```
Question: "Simplify: 2x + 3x"
Expected: "5x"
Student types: "5x is the answer"
Feedback: 5x [green] istheanswer [gray]
Message: "Just write the simplified expression"
```

### 3. Equation Solving

```
Question: "Solve for x"
Expected: "x=5"
Student types: "x=5 and y=3"
Feedback: x=5 [green] andy=3 [gray]
Message: "Only solve for x, not other variables"
```

## Technical Details

### Character Mode Logic

```
if (char === expectedChar && char !== '') {
  → GREEN (correct)
} else if (i >= expected.length && char) {
  → GRAY (exceeded length)
} else {
  → RED (incorrect)
}
```

### Term Mode Logic

```
if (token === expectedToken && token !== '') {
  → GREEN (correct)
} else if (!expectedToken && token) {
  → GRAY (no expected token = exceeded)
} else {
  → RED (incorrect)
}
```

### Key Differences

- **Character mode**: Checks index position (`i >= expected.length`)
- **Term mode**: Checks token existence (`!expectedToken`)
- Both methods achieve same goal: indicate excess input

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Type exact answer → All green
- [x] Type answer + extra chars → Green then gray
- [x] Type wrong + extra chars → Green/red then gray
- [x] Term mode: Extra tokens → Gray
- [x] Character mode: Extra chars → Gray
- [x] Gray appears after expected length ends
- [x] No gray for correct-length answers
- [x] No gray mixed with correct characters

## Console Logging

When gray colors are applied, you'll see:

```

✅ Using pre-extracted plain value: "f(x)=2x-7"
📊 Similarity: 57.1% - You're on the right track 👍
[Colored output includes gray for =2x-7]
```

## Edge Cases

### 1. All Extra (No Correct Input)

```
Expected: f(x)
Input: hello
All characters red (not gray - nothing is correct)
```

### 2. Empty Expected

```
Expected: ""
Input: "anything"
All characters gray (all exceeded empty string)
```

### 3. Partial Match Then Extra

```
Expected: ab
Input: abcd
Result: \textcolor{green}{a}\textcolor{green}{b}\textcolor{gray}{c}\textcolor{gray}{d}
```

## Performance Impact

**Negligible** - Only adds one additional condition check:

- Character mode: `i >= expected.length` (O(1))
- Term mode: `!expectedToken` (O(1))

No additional loops or complex operations.

## Accessibility

The gray color provides:

- **Visual distinction** from red (wrong) and green (correct)
- **Semantic meaning** - "this is extra, not wrong"
- **Reduced cognitive load** - clear three-state system

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Add tooltip: "Remove extra characters"
2. Show character count: "3 characters too long"
3. Different gray shades for slightly vs very exceeded
4. Auto-highlight for deletion suggestion
