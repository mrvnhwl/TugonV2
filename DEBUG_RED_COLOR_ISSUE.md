# Debug: Real-Time Color Showing Red

## Issue Report

User typed `f(x)` and it's showing in **red** instead of green, even though they believe it's correct.

## Investigation

### Expected Answer (from data)

```typescript
{ label: "substitution", answer: "f(8) = 2(8) - 7" }
```

### What User Typed

```
f(x)
```

### Why It's Red (CORRECT BEHAVIOR)

The user typed `f(x)` but the expected answer is `f(8) = 2(8) - 7`.

**After normalization:**

- Expected: `"f(8)=2(8)-7"` (spaces removed, lowercase)
- User input: `"f(x)"` (lowercase)

**Comparison:**

- `"f(x)"` !== `"f(8)=2(8)-7"` ‚ùå
- `"f(8)=2(8)-7"`.startsWith(`"f(x)"`) ‚Üí **FALSE** ‚ùå
- Result: RED is CORRECT ‚úÖ

## The Actual Problem

### Possibility 1: User Misunderstood the Step

- Question: "evaluate using f(8)"
- Step 1 expects: `f(8) = 2(8) - 7` (full substitution)
- User typed: `f(x)` (just the function notation)
- **This is wrong input**, so red is correct

### Possibility 2: Expected Answer Data is Wrong

Maybe the expected answer should be just `f(8)` for the first input?

Let me check the steps again:

```typescript
steps: [
  { label: "substitution", answer: "f(8) = 2(8) - 7" }, // Step 1
  { label: "evaluation", answer: "f(8) = 16 - 7" }, // Step 2
  { label: "final", answer: "f(8) = 9" }, // Step 3
];
```

All three steps expect `f(8)` not `f(x)`. So if the user typed `f(x)`, they're wrong.

### Possibility 3: Placeholder Issue

The placeholder shows nothing helpful. Maybe user is confused about what to type?

## Check Console Logs

When you type `f(x)` in the field, you should see:

```
‚úÖ Input handler fired at index 0
üßÆ MathField input at index 0: { plainValue: "f(x)", ... }
üé® Applying real-time coloring for step 0
‚úÖ Using pre-extracted plain value: "f(x)"

  normalizedExpected: "f(8)=2(8)-7",
  match: false,
  partialMatch: false,
  exceededMatch: false
}
‚ùå No match! Color: red
```

This will confirm what's actually being compared.

## Possible Fixes

### If Red is WRONG (user should see green):

**Option 1**: Check if expected answer is extracted with proper sanitization

```typescript
// In UserInput.tsx, log the expected answer:
console.log("Expected answer for step 0:", expectedSteps[0].answer);
```

**Option 2**: The expected answer might need sanitization too

```typescript
// In colorLatexByComparison, sanitize expected answer:
const normalizedExpected = InputValidator.sanitizeTextMathLive(expected);
```

**Option 3**: Maybe we should accept partial matches more liberally

```typescript
// Check if either starts with the other
if (
  normalizedExpected.startsWith(normalizedPlain) ||
  normalizedPlain.startsWith(
    normalizedExpected.substring(0, normalizedPlain.length)
  )
) {
  color = "green";
}
```

### If Red is CORRECT (user typed wrong answer):

The system is working correctly. The user needs to type the full substitution:
`f(8) = 2(8) - 7`

not just:
`f(x)`

## Action Items

1. **Check browser console** - Look for the debug logs with üîç emoji
2. **Verify expected answer** - Is it really `"f(8) = 2(8) - 7"`?
3. **Check user understanding** - Does the user know they need to type the full substitution?
4. **Report back** - What do the console logs show for:
   - `plainValue`
   - `expected`
   - `normalizedPlain`
   - `normalizedExpected`
