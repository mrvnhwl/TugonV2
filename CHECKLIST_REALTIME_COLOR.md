## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Run development server (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Navigate to TugonPlay page
- [ ] Select a question with MathLive input
- [ ] Start typing in the math field
- [ ] Verify text colors change (green/red)
- [ ] Check console for `ðŸŽ¨` logs
- [ ] Check console for similarity scores

### Different Scenarios

- [ ] **Correct answer:** All text turns green
- [ ] **Wrong answer:** Incorrect parts turn red
- [ ] **Partial answer:** Mixed green/red colors
- [ ] **Empty input:** No colors (graceful handling)
- [ ] **Fast typing:** Debouncing works (no lag)
- [ ] **Slow typing:** Colors update properly

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Very long expressions (10+ terms)
- [ ] Special characters (Ï€, âˆš, fractions)
- [ ] Nested parentheses
- [ ] Multiple operations (+, -, \*, /)
- [ ] Decimal numbers (3.14, 0.5)
- [ ] Negative numbers (-2x)

### Browser Testing

- [ ] Chrome/Edge (desktop)
- [ ] Firefox (desktop)
- [ ] Safari (if available)
- [ ] Mobile browser (responsive view)
- [ ] Tablet view

### Performance Testing

- [ ] No lag during typing
- [ ] Cursor doesn't jump
- [ ] Smooth debouncing (300ms)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Page load time unchanged

## Configuration Testing

### Enable/Disable

- [ ] Set `realtimeColoringEnabled = false`
- [ ] Verify coloring stops
- [ ] Set `realtimeColoringEnabled = true`
- [ ] Verify coloring resumes

### Comparison Modes

- [ ] Test with `colorComparisonMode = 'term'`
- [ ] Test with `colorComparisonMode = 'character'`
- [ ] Compare differences in behavior

### Debounce Delays

- [ ] Try `200ms` delay (faster)
- [ ] Try `500ms` delay (slower)
- [ ] Find optimal setting for your users

## Console Output Verification

### Expected Logs

```
ðŸŽ¨ Applying real-time coloring for step 0
ðŸ“Š Similarity: 75.0% - Good progress! Keep going ðŸ’ª
```

- [ ] See `ðŸŽ¨` emoji in console
- [ ] See similarity percentage
- [ ] See feedback message
- [ ] No error messages
- [ ] No warning messages

## Integration Testing

### Feedback Pipeline

- [ ] **Layer 0:** Real-time color works
- [ ] **Layer 1:** Border colors still work (on Enter)
- [ ] **Layer 2:** Short hints still trigger
- [ ] **Layer 3:** Modal still appears
- [ ] All layers work independently
- [ ] No interference between layers

### Existing Features

- [ ] Question navigation still works
- [ ] Progress tracking still works
- [ ] Success modal still appears
- [ ] Category completion still works
- [ ] All other features unchanged

## User Experience Testing

### Student Perspective

- [ ] Colors are visible and clear
- [ ] Feedback feels instant (<500ms)
- [ ] Not distracting or overwhelming
- [ ] Helps identify mistakes quickly
- [ ] Encourages continued attempts

### Teacher Perspective

- [ ] Students are more engaged
- [ ] Fewer questions asked
- [ ] Better self-correction
- [ ] Observable improvement
- [ ] System reliability

## Accessibility Testing

### Color Blindness

- [ ] Test with color blind simulator
- [ ] Consider alternative indicators
- [ ] Plan for accessible mode

### Screen Readers

- [ ] Test with screen reader (if applicable)
- [ ] Ensure ARIA labels present
- [ ] Verify semantic HTML

## Performance Benchmarks

### Metrics to Record

- [ ] Page load time: **\_\_** ms
- [ ] Input response time: **\_\_** ms
- [ ] Memory usage: **\_\_** MB
- [ ] CPU usage: **\_\_** %
- [ ] Network requests: **\_\_**

### Acceptable Ranges

- Page load: < 3 seconds
- Input response: < 100ms (after debounce)
- Memory: < 200MB
- CPU: < 50%
- Network: No additional requests

## Bug Tracking

### Known Issues

- [ ] Document any bugs found
- [ ] Note reproduction steps
- [ ] Capture screenshots/videos
- [ ] Log console errors
- [ ] Report to development team

# - Similarity percentages
```

## Emergency Rollback

If issues occur:

1. **Disable real-time coloring:**

   ```typescript
   // In UserInput.tsx, line 166:
   const [realtimeColoringEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
   ```

2. **Comment out integration:**

   ```typescript
   // Lines 1127-1137 in UserInput.tsx
   // Comment out the entire if block
   ```

3. **Revert changes:**
   ```bash
   git revert [commit-hash]
