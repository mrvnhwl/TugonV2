# BUGFIX: Filter Empty Categories and Topics Without Content

## Issue Description

**Issue 1**: Categories were appearing in ProgressMap even when they had no questions in the `tugonsense_questions` table. This caused stages to appear as "ready to start" when there was actually no content to display.

**Issue 2**: Topics were appearing in ProgressMap even when they had no categories with questions. This caused empty topic cards to be displayed.

## Root Cause

The `fetchTopicsWithCategoriesAndQuestions()` function was:

1. Fetching all categories from `tugonsense_categories` table regardless of whether they had associated questions in `tugonsense_questions` table
2. Fetching all topics from `tugonsense_topics` table regardless of whether they had any categories with questions

## Solution Implemented

### Changed Files

- `src/lib/supabaseCategories.ts`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Filter Categories Without Questions (`fetchTopicsWithCategoriesAndQuestions`)

**Location**: Lines 100-110

**Before**:

```typescript
const categoriesWithQuestions: SupabaseCategory[] = (categories || []).map(
  (category: any) => ({
    ...category,
    questions: (questions || []).filter(
      (q: any) =>
        q.topic_id === category.topic_id &&
        q.category_id === category.category_id
    ),
  })
);
```

**After**:

```typescript
const categoriesWithQuestions: SupabaseCategory[] = (categories || [])
  .map((category: any) => ({
    ...category,
    questions: (questions || []).filter(
      (q: any) =>
        q.topic_id === category.topic_id &&
        q.category_id === category.category_id
    ),
  }))
  // ✨ FILTER: Only include categories that have at least one question
  .filter(
    (category: any) => category.questions && category.questions.length > 0
  );

console.log(
  `🔍 Filtered to ${categoriesWithQuestions.length} categories with questions (removed empty categories)`
);
```

#### 2. Filter Topics Without Categories (`fetchTopicsWithCategoriesAndQuestions`)

**Location**: Lines 113-121

**Before**:

```typescript
const topicsWithCategories: SupabaseTopic[] = topics.map((topic: any) => ({
  ...topic,
  categories: categoriesWithQuestions.filter(
    (c: any) => c.topic_id === topic.id
  ),
}));
```

**After**:

```typescript
const topicsWithCategories: SupabaseTopic[] = topics
  .map((topic: any) => ({
    ...topic,
    categories: categoriesWithQuestions.filter(
      (c: any) => c.topic_id === topic.id
    ),
  }))
  // ✨ FILTER: Only include topics that have at least one category (with questions)
  .filter((topic: any) => topic.categories && topic.categories.length > 0);

console.log(
  `🔍 Filtered to ${topicsWithCategories.length} topics with categories (removed topics without categories)`
);
```

#### 3. Single Topic Fetch Function (`fetchCategoriesByTopic`)

**Location**: Lines 162-170

**Before**:

```typescript
const categoriesWithQuestions: SupabaseCategory[] = (categories || []).map(
  (category: any) => ({
    ...category,
    questions: (questions || []).filter(
      (q: any) => q.category_id === category.category_id
    ),
  })
);

return categoriesWithQuestions;
```

**After**:

```typescript
const categoriesWithQuestions: SupabaseCategory[] = (categories || [])
  .map((category: any) => ({
    ...category,
    questions: (questions || []).filter(
      (q: any) => q.category_id === category.category_id
    ),
  }))
  // ✨ FILTER: Only include categories that have at least one question
  .filter(
    (category: any) => category.questions && category.questions.length > 0
  );

return categoriesWithQuestions;
```

## How It Works

### Filter Logic

1. After grouping questions by category, we apply a `.filter()` check to remove empty categories
2. Only categories with `category.questions.length > 0` are included
3. Empty categories (those without matching questions in `tugonsense_questions`) are excluded
4. After grouping categories by topic, we apply another `.filter()` check to remove empty topics
5. Only topics with `topic.categories.length > 0` are included
6. Empty topics (those without any categories with questions) are excluded

### Database Query Flow

```
1. Fetch all topics from tugonsense_topics
2. Fetch all categories from tugonsense_categories
3. Fetch all questions from tugonsense_questions
4. Group questions by category
5. ✨ FILTER #1: Remove categories with zero questions
6. Group categories by topic
7. ✨ FILTER #2: Remove topics with zero categories (that have questions)
8. Return only topics that have categories with questions
```

## Impact

### User Experience

- ✅ **Before Fix**: Empty stages appeared, clicking "Start Stage" led to errors or blank screens
- ✅ **After Fix**: Only stages with actual questions are displayed
- ✅ Students can only start stages that have content

### Data Validation

- Categories in `tugonsense_categories` can exist without questions
- Only categories with at least one question in `tugonsense_questions` will be shown
- This follows the referential integrity: `topic_id + category_id` must exist in questions table

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Category with Questions

1. Create a category in `tugonsense_categories` with `topic_id=1, category_id=1`
2. Add questions to `tugonsense_questions` with matching `topic_id=1, category_id=1`
3. **Expected**: Category appears in ProgressMap with question count
4. **Expected**: "Start Stage" button works normally

### Test Case 2: Empty Category (No Questions)

1. Create a category in `tugonsense_categories` with `topic_id=1, category_id=99`
2. Do NOT add any questions with `category_id=99` to `tugonsense_questions`
3. **Expected**: Category does NOT appear in ProgressMap
4. **Expected**: No stage card is rendered for this category

### Test Case 3: Mixed Topic

1. Topic 1 has 3 categories:
   - Category 1: Has 5 questions ✅
   - Category 2: Has 0 questions ❌
   - Category 3: Has 3 questions ✅
2. **Expected**: ProgressMap shows only Category 1 and Category 3
3. **Expected**: Topic shows "2 categories" instead of 3

### Test Case 4: Topic Without Categories

1. Create a topic in `tugonsense_topics` with `id=99, name="Empty Topic"`
2. Do NOT add any categories in `tugonsense_categories` for this topic
3. **Expected**: Topic does NOT appear in ProgressMap
4. **Expected**: No topic card is rendered for this topic

### Test Case 5: Topic With Only Empty Categories

1. Topic 2 has 2 categories, but neither has questions:
   - Category 1: Has 0 questions ❌
   - Category 2: Has 0 questions ❌
2. **Expected**: Topic 2 does NOT appear in ProgressMap
3. **Expected**: After filtering categories, topic has 0 categories and gets filtered out

## Console Logging

When loading topics, you'll see:

```
✅ Fetched 5 topics
✅ Fetched 15 categories
✅ Fetched 45 questions
🔍 Filtered to 12 categories with questions (removed empty categories)
🔍 Filtered to 3 topics with categories (removed topics without categories)
✅ Successfully structured topics with categories and questions
📊 Topics structure: [
  { id: 1, name: 'Algebra', categoriesCount: 5, totalQuestions: 25 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Geometry', categoriesCount: 4, totalQuestions: 12 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Functions', categoriesCount: 3, totalQuestions: 8 }
]
```

The filter counts show:

- How many categories were kept after filtering (12 out of 15 had questions)
- How many topics were kept after filtering (3 out of 5 had categories with questions)
- Topics 4 and 5 were filtered out because they had no categories with questions

## Related Database Schema

### tugonsense_topics Table

```sql
create table public.tugonsense_topics (
  id bigserial not null,
  name text not null,
  description text null,
  -- ... other fields
  constraint tugonsense_topics_pkey primary key (id)
)
```

### tugonsense_categories Table

```sql
create table public.tugonsense_categories (
  id bigserial not null,
  topic_id integer not null,
  category_id integer not null,
  title text not null,
  category_question text null,
  -- ... other fields
  constraint tugonsense_categories_topic_id_fkey
    foreign KEY (topic_id)
    references tugonsense_topics (id)
    on delete CASCADE
)
```

### tugonsense_questions Table

```sql
create table public.tugonsense_questions (
  id bigserial not null,
  topic_id integer not null,
  category_id integer not null,
  question_id integer not null,
  -- ... other fields
  constraint tugonsense_questions_topic_id_category_id_fkey
    foreign KEY (topic_id, category_id)
    references tugonsense_categories (topic_id, category_id)
    on delete CASCADE
)
```

### Key Points

- **Foreign key chain**: `questions → categories → topics`
- **Filter #1**: Removes categories without questions from UI
- **Filter #2**: Removes topics without categories (that have questions) from UI
- This maintains data integrity while improving UX
- Database can have "draft" or "placeholder" topics/categories that won't show until they have content

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **All categories empty in a topic**: Topic gets filtered out (0 categories with questions)
2. **Null questions array**: Filter checks `category.questions && category.questions.length > 0`
3. **Null categories array**: Filter checks `topic.categories && topic.categories.length > 0`
4. **Topic with no categories in database**: Gets filtered out after empty categories array
5. **All topics empty**: ProgressMap shows "No topics available" message
6. **Concurrent data changes**: Filters run on every fetch, always shows current state
7. **Partial data loading**: If questions fail to load, all categories are filtered out, then all topics are filtered out

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Filters run in-memory after data fetch
- **Complexity**:
  - O(c) for category filter, where c = number of categories
  - O(t) for topic filter, where t = number of topics
  - Total: O(c + t) - linear time complexity
- **Trade-off**: Slight processing time vs. cleaner UX (worth it)
- **Memory**: No additional memory overhead, filters in place

## Future Considerations

1. **Database-Level Count**: Could add `question_count` column to `tugonsense_categories` for faster filtering
2. **Caching**: Could cache category-question counts to reduce repeated filters
3. **Trigger**: Could add database trigger to auto-update `is_active` flag when questions are added/removed

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Empty categories are now filtered out at data fetch level
✅ **FIXED** - Empty topics (without categories with questions) are now filtered out
✅ **TESTED** - No compilation errors
✅ **DEPLOYED** - Ready for user testing
