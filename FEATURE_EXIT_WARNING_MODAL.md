# Feature: Exit Warning Modal

## Overview

Added a confirmation modal that appears when users try to exit TugonPlay by clicking the "✕" button, preventing accidental exits and data loss.

## Implementation Date

October 13, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Added State Management

**File:** `src/pages/reviewer/TugonPlay.tsx`

```typescript
const [showExitWarning, setShowExitWarning] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Created Handler Functions

```typescript
// Show warning modal
const handleExitClick = () => {
  setShowExitWarning(true);
};

// Cancel exit and continue playing
const handleCancelExit = () => {
  setShowExitWarning(false);
};

// Confirm exit and navigate to TugonSense
const handleConfirmExit = () => {
  setShowExitWarning(false);
  navigate("/tugonsense");
};
```

### 3. Updated Exit Buttons

Changed both mobile and desktop exit buttons from:

```typescript
onClick={() => navigate("/tugonsense")}
```

To:

```typescript
onClick = { handleExitClick };
```

### 4. Created Warning Modal UI

Added a beautiful, centered modal with:

- **Warning Icon**: Yellow circular icon with exclamation mark
- **Title**: "Are you sure you want to quit?"
- **Description**: Explains that progress is saved but needs to restart
- **Two Buttons**:
  - **"No, Keep Going"** (Primary, teal) - Cancels exit
  - **"Yes, Quit"** (Secondary, gray) - Confirms exit

## UI Design

### Modal Features

- ✅ Fixed overlay with backdrop blur
- ✅ Centered card with shadow
- ✅ Smooth fade-in and zoom-in animation
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Accessible button styles with hover/active states

### Color Scheme

- Primary button: `#397F85` (TugonPlay teal)
- Secondary button: Gray `#E5E7EB`
- Background overlay: Black 50% with blur

## User Experience

### Flow

1. User clicks "✕" button (mobile or desktop)
2. Modal appears with warning message
3. User chooses:
   - **"No, Keep Going"** → Modal closes, stays in TugonPlay
   - **"Yes, Quit"** → Modal closes, navigates to TugonSense

### Benefits

- ✅ Prevents accidental exits
- ✅ Reminds users their progress is saved
- ✅ Clear choice with two distinct options
- ✅ Professional, polished UX

## Notes

- Modal uses z-index of 50 to appear above all content
- Animation uses Tailwind's `animate-in` utilities
- Both mobile and desktop versions share the same modal component
- No external dependencies required - pure React + Tailwind
