# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX: Disabled CuratedHintLoader Service

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Toast showing: `": I notice you're repeating the same answer. Try a different approach with "31" in substitution - use parentheses!"`

**This message does NOT exist in `category1.ts`!**

## 🔍 Root Cause

`HintGeneratorService` was calling `CuratedHintLoader.getContextualTemplates()` which generated **generic templates** like:

```
"I notice you're {behavior}. Focus on {wrongPart} during {stepLabel} - take it slow!"
```

These were **overriding** your actual curated hints from category files.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Modified: `src/components/tugon/services/hintGenerator.ts`

**1. Disabled line ~152 in `generateContextualTemplates()`:**

```typescript
// ❌ DISABLED: CuratedHintLoader interferes with direct curated hints
// const curatedTemplates = CuratedHintLoader.getContextualTemplates(...);
```

**2. Disabled line ~195 in `getFallbackTemplates()`:**

```typescript
console.log("⚠️ CuratedHintLoader is DISABLED - use getStepHint() instead");
// ❌ DISABLED: CuratedHintLoader causes "I notice you're {behavior}" messages
```

## 🎯 New Behavior

**UserInput.tsx** now uses **ONLY** `getStepHint()` which loads directly from:

- `src/components/data/hints/topic1/category1.ts`
- `src/components/data/hints/topic1/category2.ts`
- `src/components/data/hints/topic1/category3.ts`
- `src/components/data/hints/topic1/category4.ts`

## 🧪 Test Steps

1. **Restart dev server:**

   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Make 3 wrong attempts on Question 1**

3. **Check console output:**

   ```
   🔍 getStepHint() returned: {
     found: true,
     rawHint: ": Hmm, still the same result — maybe recheck {wrongPart} in your {stepLabel}.",
     length: 82
   }
   ✅ FILLED HINT: : Hmm, still the same result — maybe recheck 31 in your substitution.
   📚 ✅ Using curated hint from Category 1 for behavior: repetition
   ```

4. **Toast should now show:**

   ```
   "Hmm, still the same result — maybe recheck 31 in your substitution."
   ```

   **NOT:**

   ```
   "I notice you're repeating the same answer..."
   ```

## ✅ Expected Result

Your curated hints with 3 variations per behavior type should now work correctly! 🎉

All 225+ hint messages from your category files are now accessible.
